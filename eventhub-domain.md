# EventHub Domain Knowledge

## Overview
EventHub is a full-stack event ticket booking platform. Users browse events, book tickets, and manage bookings. Each user operates in an isolated sandbox with limits on events and bookings.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query v5
- **Backend**: Express.js 4.21, Prisma ORM 5.22, MySQL 8+
- **Auth**: JWT (7-day expiry), bcryptjs password hashing
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E (`tests/`, JavaScript, Chromium) and Selenium WebDriver E2E (`selenium/`, Core Java + TestNG + Maven, Chrome). Each suite runs serially against the live site. They use different users (Playwright: `rahulshetty1@gmail.com` / `@yahoo.com`; Selenium: its own `eventhub-selenium-*@qa-sandbox.dev` pair), so the two suites can run in parallel
- **API Docs**: Swagger UI at `/api/docs`

## Test Environment
- **Site**: `https://eventhub.rahulshettyacademy.com`
- **API**: `https://api.eventhub.rahulshettyacademy.com/api` (the site's own `/api` path serves the Next.js app, not the backend)
- **Coding standards**: `playwright-best-practices` (Playwright) and `selenium-best-practices` (Selenium Java). This skill holds the facts both suites assert on; those skills hold how to write the tests

# EventHub Business Rules

## 1. User Journey
- User signs up or signs in -> browses events -> selects an event -> books tickets
- On booking: seat count reduces immediately, booking reference is generated
- Booking reference first character MUST match the event title's first character (e.g., Event "Tech Summit" -> Ref starts with "T")
- After booking, user can view bookings via "View My Bookings" link or "View Details"
- User can cancel (delete) individual bookings or "Clear All Bookings" in one action
- Users can also create events from the Admin UI or via API

## 2. User Sandbox Isolation
- Each user only sees their own dynamic events and bookings
- Static events (seeded) are shared across all users
- Cross-user access to bookings returns 403 Forbidden ("Access Denied")
- Deleting a user cascades to their events and bookings

## 3. Event Limits (FIFO Pruning)
- Max **6 user-created events** per account
- When limit reached, the OLDEST event is automatically deleted (FIFO replacement)
- Static events are not counted toward this limit
- Static events cannot be edited or deleted
- Events page shows 12 events per page, with pagination

## 4. Booking Limits (FIFO Pruning)
- Max **9 bookings** per user
- When limit reached, the OLDEST booking is automatically deleted (FIFO replacement)
- The bookings list never holds more than 9 bookings, because of the limit above
- Booking deletion (cancellation) immediately frees seats
- "Clear all bookings" (top of the bookings page, behind a native `confirm()`) removes all bookings in one go. The page labels it "Do this often for clean test data"
- Test impact: the test account is shared by every run, so tests must delete only the bookings they created and must not use "Clear all bookings" as cleanup

## 5. Sandbox Warning Banner
- **Events page only**: the banner appears when more than 5 events are listed (6 or more). Text: "Your sandbox holds up to 9 bookings and you can create up to 6 custom events. When either limit is reached, the oldest entry is automatically replaced."
- It's hidden when 5 or fewer events are listed (`sandbox-banner.spec.js` checks 6 shown, 4 hidden)
- The bookings page has no sandbox banner

## 6. Per-User Seat Availability
- For static events: `availableSeats` is a fixed DB field
- For dynamic (user-created) events: computed as `totalSeats - sum(user's booking quantities for that event)`
- This allows the same user to book the same event multiple times for testing
- Seat count reduces immediately on booking confirmation

## 7. Booking Reference Format
- Pattern: `[FIRST_LETTER]-[6_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC]`
- **First letter comes from the event title (uppercase)** - this is a key business rule to validate
- Example: Event "Tech Summit" -> Ref: `T-A3B2C1`
- Guaranteed unique via collision retry

## 8. Refund Eligibility (Client-Side Logic)
- **Single ticket bookings (quantity = 1) -> Eligible for refund** with message "Single-ticket bookings qualify for a full refund"
- **Multi-ticket bookings (quantity > 1) -> NOT eligible for refund** with message "Group bookings (N tickets) are non-refundable"
- Displays a **4-second spinner** animation before revealing the result
- This is frontend-only logic (no backend API for refund)
- Accessible via "Check Refund Eligibility" button on booking detail page

## 9. Price Calculation
- `totalPrice = event.price x quantity`
- Price is per-ticket in the Event model

# EventHub UI Selectors Reference

Selectors are written in Playwright syntax. For Selenium Java, translate them as described in `selenium-best-practices` §2: `getByTestId('x')` → `Locators.testId("x")`, `#id` → `By.id("id")`, `getByPlaceholder('p')` → `By.cssSelector("[placeholder='p']")`, and labels → the input's id.

Prefer `data-testid` hooks (listed at the end) over the other selectors whenever one exists.

## Login Page
- Email input: `getByPlaceholder('you@email.com')` or `getByLabel('Email')` (id `email`)
- Password input: `getByLabel('Password')` or `getByPlaceholder('••••••')` (id `password`)
- Login button: `#login-btn`

## Home Page
- Browse Events link: `getByRole('link', { name: 'Browse Events →' })` (tests wait for it to confirm login finished)
- Navigation: `getByTestId('nav-home')`, `getByTestId('nav-events')`, `getByTestId('nav-bookings')`
- Logged-in user: `getByTestId('user-email-display')`; logout: `getByTestId('logout-btn')`

## Register Page
- Email: `getByTestId('register-email')`
- Password: `getByTestId('register-password')`
- Submit: `getByTestId('register-btn')`

## Events Page
- Event cards: `getByTestId('event-card')`
- Book Now button: `getByTestId('book-now-btn')` (inside card)
- Sandbox banner: `getByText(/sandbox holds up to/i)`
- Category/City/Search filters: form controls

## Event Detail / Booking Form
- Ticket count display: `#ticket-count`
- Increment/Decrement: `button:has-text("+")` / `button:has-text("-")`
- Full Name: `getByLabel('Full Name')` (id `customerName`)
- Email: `#customer-email` or `getByTestId('customer-email')`
- Phone: `getByPlaceholder('+91 98765 43210')` (id `phone`)
- Confirm: `.confirm-booking-btn` (id `confirm-booking`)
- Booking Ref on the confirmation card: `getByTestId('booking-ref')` (also `.booking-ref`)

## Admin Event Form
- Form: `getByTestId('admin-event-form')`
- Title: `#event-title-input` or `getByTestId('event-title-input')`
- Description: `#admin-event-form textarea`
- City: `getByLabel('City')`
- Venue: `getByLabel('Venue')`
- Date: `getByLabel('Event Date & Time')`
- Price: `getByLabel('Price ($)')`
- Seats: `getByLabel('Total Seats')`
- Add button: `#add-event-btn` or `getByTestId('add-event-btn')`
- Event rows: `getByTestId('event-table-row')`, with `edit-event-btn` / `delete-event-btn` inside

## Bookings Page
- Booking cards: `getByTestId('booking-card')`
- Booking ref on a card: `getByTestId('booking-ref')` (also `.booking-ref`). Filter cards by it on the shared account
- Booking id on a card: `getByTestId('booking-id')`
- Cancel from a card: `getByTestId('cancel-booking-btn')`, then confirm with `getByTestId('confirm-dialog-yes')` in the "Cancel this booking?" dialog
- View Details link: `getByRole('link', { name: 'View Details' })`
- Clear all: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Clear all bookings' })` at the top of the page; it opens a native `confirm()`

## Booking Detail Page
- Booking ref: `span.font-mono.font-bold` (no `data-testid` yet)
- Event title: `h1`
- Check refund: `#check-refund-btn` or `getByTestId('check-refund-btn')`
- Refund spinner: `#refund-spinner` or `getByTestId('refund-spinner')`
- Refund result: `#refund-result` or `getByTestId('refund-result')`
- Cancel button: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Cancel Booking' })` (no `data-testid` on this page), then confirm with `getByTestId('confirm-dialog-yes')` in the "Cancel this booking?" dialog

## All `data-testid` Hooks in the Frontend
`nav-home`, `nav-events`, `nav-bookings`, `user-email-display`, `logout-btn`, `register-email`, `register-password`, `register-btn`, `event-card`, `book-now-btn`, `customer-email`, `booking-ref`, `admin-event-form`, `event-title-input`, `add-event-btn`, `event-table-row`, `edit-event-btn`, `delete-event-btn`, `booking-card`, `booking-id`, `check-refund-btn`, `refund-spinner`, `refund-result`, `cancel-booking-btn`, `confirm-dialog-yes`
